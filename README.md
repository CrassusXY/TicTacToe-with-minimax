# TicTacToe with minimax algorithm

## Task 
My task was to implement a tic-tac-toe game with minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. The user can choose whether he wants to be the first or second player and the size of the board he wants to play on. Another option is to choose how many figures in a row are required to win the game.

## Results
The entire minimax implementation and code description can be found in the file `PAMSI_3.pdf`, which is written in Polish.

## Running the program
After cloning the repository, you just need to run the ` make ` command. Later you can run the program using ` /tictactoe.out`.
